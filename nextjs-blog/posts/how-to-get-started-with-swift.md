If you are interested in **iOS development** like I am, the best language to learn is **Swift**! The native and modern language made by the one and only **Apple**!

I have tried multiple languages when it comes to Mobile App Development; anywhere from Java/Kotlin for Android development on Android Studio, to React-Native and Objective-C for iOS applications with Xcode, so I do have some knowledge in the **Mobile App Development** field.

Over the course of my time learning how to develop mobile apps, I compiled a list of resources that have helped me learn.

### Udemy

One of my favorite methods of learning new technologies is through videos. My first exposure to Swift was a course off of Udemy, a platform for online courses.

The course I took was [**iOS 13 & Swift 5 - The Complete iOS App Development Bootcamp**](https://www.udemy.com/course/ios-13-app-development-bootcamp/) by Dr. Angela Yu

### raywenderlich.com

Another very popular online resource was [raywenderlich's](https://www.raywenderlich.com/ios) compliation of videos for understand everything from the basics of Swift UI to real-world iOS applications.

I have not spent that much time on this site, but I do know its a very popular option for people learning Swift.

### Hacking with Swift

The last resource and my most recent find is [Hacking with Swift](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/learn). They have a program called the 100-day challenge for SwiftUI and UIKit. I 100% recommend them. I do want to emphasis that the pace in the first 30 days of the challenge can be quite slow, but from there it takes off.

Hope this helps and happy hacking (-:
