Software engineers have this stigma around their personality and their inability to be social. This was definitely more prominent a couple years ago since becoming a _coder_ has become more _mainstream_.

Unfortunately there is so much communication needed in building a large scalable application/product that people who do not work in the industry understand. Especially for myself; I have struggled with describing a problem over a text message and voice calls (since I work remotely).

How do I plan to strengthen this weakness? Obviously just talk more, speak to my co-workers and having high level conversations with them about problems, tickets, design. But another way that I feel like people don't take advantage of is reading, or if you're not a fan of reading, then listening.

**PODCAST** are sooooooo useful, they are easy, reliable, and fun at most time. The benefit of listening to podcasts when you are brushing your teeth, washing up, or any other task that require little attention, allows you to fit it into a busy schedule very easily.

It's something I try to do every morning and will continue to do. Its a great way to stimulate the brain with ideas and thoughts.
