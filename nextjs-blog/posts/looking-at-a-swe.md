**LETS GOOOO**

Crazy journey getting here... I have reached the first stepping stone in my early career and just started working for a great company, in a great industry, for a great cause.

I wanted my work to make an impact; it was probably one of the biggest things I was looking. Gladly, I'll be working in the EdTech industry. Basically I have been working on making sure my company integrates well with other educational platforms and tools. I'm pretty sure I'm a full-stack engineer, but like an emphasis in backend?? IDK. But i'm learning two new technologies on top of a new industry, which has been overwhelming but crazy exciting.

To be completely honest, I thought I was on the road to start as a front-end engineer (because that is where most my experience is from), then work my way to a SWE and full-stack SWE. But, I skipped that step and found a team that saw potential in me and truly believed in my skills as a Software Engineer.

With this new job, I can help my mom quit one of her jobs (hopefully).. Just wanted to update everyone (anyone there?) on my life.

Matt
