I don't want to be that **Typescript** fan-boy but man is typescript a life-saver. I'm going to jot down some notes about why I think typscript is a great language to learn.

If you don't know what typescript is, its basically a superset of JS, with types, hence the name typescript. If you want to go out into the real world of developing large-scale applications then typescript is a must, for yourself, and your collegues.

We can break this down into simple-er terms by saying typescript is known as an **Object-oriented programming language** and javascript is a **scripting language**.

I mean typescript can just do more. Thats literally all I should need to say to get you to learn it. People make the case that a lot of its code is unecessary and yes, javascript works fine on its own, but what sounds better?: stupid little errors that happen (typescript) or errors and you don't even know why (javascript).

### A better on-boarding experience

Yes javascript is fine, and its dynamically typed system does the trick for some teams. But imagine a new dev for your team joining. Their on-boarding would be significantly more complicated. Joining a project is daunting on itself and imagine having to dynamically process the types of a giant project. Typescript and its static types helps with understanding code bases, which I think can vastly improve efficiency within the workspace.

A small price to learn for a such a large amount of gain.

I am in the process of learning **Typescript** and I have been loving it. I hope you do it.

I would love to hear your thoughts on Typescript, If you don't use it, tell me why!
