## Crypto

is one of those things that everyone would love to get into, and I have been interested in it since 2018. I started working at a company around that time that was producing their own coins and NFTs before NFTs were a thing. It was an unpaid internship that was super unorganzied which I later left because I was not motivated. Fast forward to a couple months ago, crypto resurrects and hits ATHs and I become interested, yet again.

Decided that since I finished school and finally had some funding, I would actually do a deeper dive into crypto. So here I am talking about some of the resources that I used to become more familiar with a technology that is still in its infancy.

### Resources:

_Some of the places I used to learn more_

**Youtube**

- I mean obviously youtube. Specific youtubers that help explain the concept and techonology behind crypto and blockchain are: Andrei Jikh and 99Bitcoin.

- I watched Andrei Jikh when he was still just a finance youtuber, and he started making crypto videos right around when I started learning. 99Bitcoin has been educating about crypto for a long time and produce very dumb-downed explainations about everything crypto, which I think appeals to the majority of the people.

**Discord, Tiktok:**

- Yes, I know, Tiktok... But within all the dumb shit and scammy vibes I get from tiktok, there are a select few videos and "creators" that I believe are genuine, with good advice. I'll probably edit this to mention a few, later on.

- Discord as well, or any other forums like reddit, where you can discuss with a community. I will be honest and say that there are a lot of kids and people who just spam DOGE, SAFEMOON, etc.. Pumper and dumpers. But some people have actually given good information on how to get started in trading alt coins.

Obviously, do your own research for everything that you buy in the crypto market. Scams are everywhere because people can easily get away with it. Not financial advice.
